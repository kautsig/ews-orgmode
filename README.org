* Overview
  ews-orgmode is a python script to fetch your exchange calendar using exchange webservices and format it
  into an orgmode readable format for using it in your orgmode agenda.

* Installation
  Clone the repository using:

  : git clone http://github.com/kautsig/ews-orgmode.git

  Change into the directory and create a config file:

  : cd ews-orgmode
  : cp config.cfg.sample config.cfg
  : vim config.cfg

  The config.cfg is within the .gitignore file, so you don't publish it by accident.
  Now, run the script:

  : ./ews-fetch-calendar.py

  If everythings ok, you should see your exchange calendar in orgmode format as console output. You 
  can redirect it into an orgmode file for using in your agenda. E.g. you could  use something like this
  in a cronjob:

  : ./ews-fetch-calendar.py > ~/org/exchange.org

* Disclaimer
  Use the script at your own risk. Read it, understand it, modify it. But do not
  blame me if something goes wrong.
